pizza
Pizza dough is a yeasted dough which requires active dry yeast. Make sure the check the expiration date on the yeast package! Yeast that is too old may be dead and won't work.

You can use all purpose flour instead of the bread flour that is called for in the recipe, but bread flour is higher in gluten than all-purpose flour and will make a crispier crust for your pizza.

Cup measurements can vary depending on how you are scooping the flour (we fluff the flour, lightly scoop it, and level with a knife). So I recommend using a kitchen scale to measure out the flour amounts by weight. This is the only way you'll get a consistently accurate measurement.

Eggless Vanilla Cake: When I posted this eggless vanilla cupcake recipe a few weeks back, I was being asked if it could be baked without the egg replacer powder.

I suggested increasing the quantity of baking powder to substitute EnerG. Some did it and got good results and some didn’t.

I too made some changes to that recipe to bake it without EnerG but did not get satisfactory results.

The cupcakes did not turn out as good as the ones with Ener-G. So I was looking for another eggless vanilla cake recipe which can be baked with simple ingredients and landed on this one.

I have come across this recipe before and somehow didn’t get a chance to try it until recently. Since the visitors’ request for a simple eggless cake was becoming more frequent I decided to give it a try and I would say that I was not disappointed at all.

It was not as fluffy and airy as the cupcakes but was definitely a decent recipe.

After going through the reviews of the original recipe I have made a couple of changes to make it better.

The only other thing I would like to try the next time is to use cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. I think that particular variation will give a lighter texture to the cake. So do try it when you get a chance.
